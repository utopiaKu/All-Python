# 30 Days of Python Learning

Welcome to the "30 Days of Python Learning" challenge! This is a guide for those who want to dive into Python programming. Each day, you'll tackle new concepts and practice exercises. Let's get started!

## Variables and Data Types

- Learn about variables, types (strings, integers, floats, booleans).
- Understand type conversion and casting.

**Practice:**
- Create variables of different data types and print them.
- Experiment with type conversion (e.g., `int("10")`, `float(20)`).

---
##  Operators

- Explore arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
- Practice using operators in Python expressions.

**Exercise:**
- Create simple programs using different types of operators.

---
##  Conditional Statements

- Learn about `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- Understand logical conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`).

**Practice:**
- Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

---

Loops

- Learn about `for` loops and `while` loops.
- Practice using loops to repeat tasks.

**Exercise:**
- Print numbers from 1 to 10 using both `for` and `while` loops.

---

##  Functions

- Learn how to define and call functions.
- Understand function parameters and return values.

**Practice:**
- Write functions that take arguments and return results (e.g., calculator functions).

---

##  Lists

- Understand how to create, access, and modify lists.
- Explore list methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, etc.

**Exercise:**
- Create a list of numbers and find the sum using a loop or built-in function.

---

##  Tuples

- Learn about tuples and their immutability.
- Practice accessing and slicing tuples.
Dictionaries

- Learn how to work with dictionaries (key-value pairs).
- Practice adding, accessing, and modifying dictionary items.

**Exercise:**
- Create a dictionary with personal information and access individual values.

---

##  Sets

- Understand sets and their properties (unique, unordered).
- Learn common set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

**Exercise:**
- Create a set and perform set operations like union and intersection.

---

## String Manipulation

- Learn common string methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.split()`, `.join()`, etc.
- Work with string formatting.

**Exercise:**
- Manipulate strings, reverse strings, and count occurrences of characters.
